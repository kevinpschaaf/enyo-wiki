# Server Considerations

This page documents specific issues seen when hosting Enyo applications on Web servers with certain configurations.

## mod_pagespeed

Enyo works well with most Web server configurations.  However, the package loader code does rely on finding and 
updating specific script tags in your document in order to work correctly.  The default configuration of 
the Apache module [mod_pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/mod) may alter script tags 
on pages it serves.  Alterations may include combining multiple script files and
[inlining some of them ](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/mod_pagespeed/filter-js-inline) into the 
HTML document.

For a deployed Bootplate application in which all of the JavaScript has been reduced to two files, this may not be a problem.  However, during debugging, when you are loading multiple JavaScript files specified in your `package.js` 
files, this *will* cause problems.  To disable the inlining of `mod_pagespeed`, you can change the `script`
tag that pulls in `enyo.js` to have some inline data in the body of the tag, e.g., changing

    <script src="enyo/enyo.js"></script>

to

    <script src="enyo/enyo.js">NOINLINE</script>
